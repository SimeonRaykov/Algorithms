// # Loan allocation coding challenge

// One of the requirements of the Funding Circle marketplace is that it fairly allocates loans to investors, 
// within the constraints of certain investor specified criteria.

// In this coding challenge you are required to write some code that takes as input a set of loans and a set of investors, 
// and returns as output a structure indicating which loans have been allocated to each investor. Each loan can only be 
// allocated to a single investor, and investors will only fund loans that meet their specified criteria. 

// ## Loans

// Loans are modelled such that they have the following attributes:

// * *id* - The unique ID of the loan
// * *category* - The category of the loan (Property, Retail, Medical)
// * *risk_band* - The risk band associated with the loan (A+, A, B, C, D, E)
// * *amount* - The amount of the loan in Â£

// So an example loan would look something like:

// ```
// {
//   "id": 1234567,
//   "category": "property",
//   "risk_band": "A",
//   "amount": 1000
// }
// ```

// ## Investors
// As mentioned above, your code should fairly allocate loans according to certain investor specified criteria. Investors
// should also not be able to fund more loans than they have money to invest.

// Plan your system to meet the requirements of the first three investors, *Bob*, *Susan*, and *George*. Once you are able 
// to reach a working solution for Part I, think about how to extend your system to cover *Helen* and *Jamie*'s use cases. 

// **Part I**
// * *Bob* - only wants to invest in property loans.
// * *Susan* - will invest in either property or retail loans.
// * *George* - only wants to invest in "A" grade loans.

// **Part II** 

// - *Helen* - wants to invest in a maximum of 40% property loans.
// - *Jamie* - wants to invest only in high grade (>= B) property loans.

// ## Notes
// * All state should be handled in memory
// * Make sure to talk about your thought process as you complete the challenge
